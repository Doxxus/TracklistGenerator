# TrackList Generator

I needed a program that could parse Ableton Live project files (the software I use to make my mixes) and generate a timestamped tracklist, so I can build my JSON for my mixes.doxxus.ca project, as building the tracklists manually took a ton of time and I was getting tired of doing that. So I build this.
Probably not all that usefull to most people, but the codebase should provide a base for people looking to decompress and extract Ableton project file XMLs.

Currently the program only works for Ableton Project version: 5.12.0, but I have plans to make it configurable in the future. Just needed a quick and dirty solution now.
